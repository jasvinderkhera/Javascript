Map and Filter

Assignment:

Suppose you have an array of objects representing books in a library. Each object has the following properties:

javascript
Copy code
const library = [
  { title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', pages: 180 },
  { title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee', pages: 281 },
  { title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell', pages: 328 },
  { title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen', pages: 279 },
  { title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', author: 'J.D. Salinger', pages: 224 },
  { title: 'Animal Farm', author: 'George Orwell', pages: 112 }
];
Use the filter() function to create a new array containing only the books written by George Orwell.
Use the map() function to create a new array containing just the titles of the books.



Sure! Here are five beginner-level JavaScript questions that involve using filter() and map() functions:

Question 1:

Given an array of numbers, write a function to filter out all the even numbers and return a new array containing only the odd numbers.

Question 2:

Given an array of strings representing names, write a function to filter out all the names that start with the letter 'A' and return a new array containing only those names.

Question 3:

Given an array of objects representing products, each with name and price properties, write a function to filter out all products that are cheaper than $50 and return a new array containing only those products.

Question 4:

Given an array of numbers, write a function to map each number to its square (i.e., multiply each number by itself) and return a new array containing the squared numbers.

Question 5:

Given an array of strings representing words, write a function to map each word to its length and return a new array containing the lengths of the words.
